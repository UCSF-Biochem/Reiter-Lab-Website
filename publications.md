## Jeremy Reiter MD, PhD Principal Investigator
Jeremy Reiter is the chairperson of the Department of Biochemistry and Biophysics. His lab investigates how cilia form, signal and function in intercellular communication. In particular, the Reiter lab investigates how Smoothened, a critical component of the Hedgehog pathway, localizes to and works in cilia, how ciliated cancers can be treated, how  the transition zone controls ciliary composition, and how cilia regulate adult tissue homeostasis.
